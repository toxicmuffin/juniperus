\# Your Personal Philosophy of Value

If you don't believe there is any value in cryptocurrency, you probably shouldn't throw money at it. Always do your own research and come to your own conclusions. Invest at your own risk and with what you are willing to lose. Make sure you believe there is value in something you are investing in. Remember, this is your money, you earned it and be smart with it.

  
\# What Is CryptocurrencyCryptocurrency is supposed to be the better form of \[fiat\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp")), providing decentralization and security. Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that represents a \[store of value, medium of exchange and a unit of account\]([https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/fiat-vs-crypto-digital-currencies](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/fiat-vs-crypto-digital-currencies "https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/fiat-vs-crypto-digital-currencies")) that is built on a \[blockchain\]([https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-technology-explained](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-technology-explained "https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-technology-explained")). The blockchain is an immutable ledger that runs on code, protocols, and governed by a decentralised network. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin and since it was the first, it is the most well known and adopted cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was released in 2009 by an unknown entity known as \[Satoshi Nakamoto\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto")). Since then, other cryptocurrencies with their own blockchains, protocols and code have been developed. These are called altcoins because they launched after bitcoin and there are approximately \~8,573 cryptos according to \[CoinMarketCap\]([https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/ "https://coinmarketcap.com/")).  
\# Coins or TokensThere is a \[difference\]([https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-the-difference-between-coins-and-tokens](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-the-difference-between-coins-and-tokens "https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-the-difference-between-coins-and-tokens")) between coins and tokens. A coin is a cryptocurrency that has its own blockchain like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin. A Token is a cryptocurrency that is built on a preexisting blockchain like ERC-20 tokens (Ethereum Blockchain). MakerDao’s stablecoin DAI or Uniswap’s UNI token are developed with ERC-20, making them tokens of the Ethereum network.  
\# Types of Blockchain Validation  
\## Proof of WorkProof of work (\[POW\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp"))) is a ledger distributed across a network of computers that validates a block before it gets appended to the blockchain. Due to the nature validation any tampering that is done to the block will change the way the data on the block and will not pass validation, therefore won’t be appended to the blockchain. This process is called mining and when a block is discovered, it rewards the miner. This is of course an oversimplification of how POW works and more details will be covered in the future, for now you can read more about it \[here\]([https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work "https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work")).  
\## Proof of StakeProof of stake (\[POS\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp"))) is a different way blocks are validated. The key difference between POW and POS is that POW requires miners to have hardware. This can become costly and economically questionable at times due to the amount of energy that is required to validate blocks. POS is supposed to solve that problem by having stakeholders stake their tokens to become validators, thus eliminating the need for hardware. The more a user stakes, the more likely they will validate a block. Here’s a \[video\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3EFi_POhps&t=143s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3EFi_POhps&t=143s "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3EFi_POhps&t=143s")) explaining this concept more in depth.  
\# Lingo  
\## You Are Your Own Bank And What That EntailsBeing your own bank is a lot of responsibility. It means that you are the overseer of your investments. You shouldn't go around telling people that you are X amount deep in crypto or just started a mining farm. There are not very nice people out there and these are not covered by insurance. Additionally you are responsible if you get scammed, do your due diligence and research something before you commit. Make sure the wallet you are about to use is tried and proven. Once a transaction is made, there is no way of reversing the mistake. Always make sure when transfering funds it's to the right wallet. Cryptos get lost all the time from simple mistakes. Keep your wallet and phrases safe as possible.  
__**NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS, PHRASES, OR OTHER FORMS THAT DICTATE OWNERSHIP OF A WALLET. SERVICES, USERS, OR OTHER ENTITIES WILL NEVER ASK YOU FOR THIS. IT IS A SCAM IF THEY DO. SAY THIS OUT LOUD TEN TIMES.**__  
\## White Paper.The term white paper is thrown around often and you should have a general idea of what it entails. White paper refers to the technical soup of a technology and how it's supposed to work. It is the cold hard facts of the machine without the marketing and PR involved. White paper is supposed to be the proof of concept and direction that the technology will follow. For example \[Bitcoin's White Paper\]([https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper "https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper")).  
\## The TrilemmaThe impossible triangle for crypto involves scalability, decentralization, and security. Improving or focusing on one of these aspects will reduce the effectiveness of the other. For example, if a block chain improved scalability, it would weaken security and or decentralization. If it improved decentralization and scalability, it would affect the security. This is the main problem that each technology and project tries to accomplish and why the pros and cons must be taken into account. \[Here is a detailed article about this issue.\]([https://medium.com/@aakash_13214/the-scalability-trilemma-in-blockchain-75fb57f646df](https://medium.com/@aakash_13214/the-scalability-trilemma-in-blockchain-75fb57f646df "https://medium.com/@aakash_13214/the-scalability-trilemma-in-blockchain-75fb57f646df"))  
\# Wallets\[Wallets\]([https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-wallet-types](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-wallet-types "https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-wallet-types")) are the medium where cryptocurrencies are stored. They can take the form of software, hardware, service or paper. Wallets store the public and private keys for crypto. There are a wide range of different wallets to use from. Different wallets serve different purposes and provide different levels of security. You should be able to find recommended wallets through the cryptos website. As always, before commiting to one, do your own research. Here is a link for those of you that want to go down a \[wallet rabbit hole\]([https://walletscrutiny.com/](https://walletscrutiny.com/ "https://walletscrutiny.com/")).  
\## Hot Wallets & Cold Wallets  
Hot wallets can be considered a wallet you carry around for everyday use. You don't keep everything you own in it because of the risk involved. These wallets are always connected to the internet and because of this have a risk of being hacked. A cold wallet would be the equivalent of a vault or safe. Cold wallets are generally referred to hardware wallets due to the keys that sign a transaction happen only on the hardware.   
There are other methods that have been used in the past and don't seem to hold true to today's standard like paper wallets, cold storage, or offline wallets due to the fact that hardware wallets are the most secure.  
__**MAKE SURE THE WALLET YOU USE IS LEGIT AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE COMMITTING. THERE ARE A LOT OF FRAUDS OUT THERE.**__  
\## Hot Wallets

\# Exchanges  
Users will have the option of using a custodial, non-custodial, or decentralized exchange. Most users will start off using a custodial exchange due to the sheer ease of use. Each type of these exchanges have their pros and cons. Custodial exchanges allow users to deal with fiat by depositing or withdrawing. Non-custodial exchanges are a cheap way of exchanging one coin to another avoiding the fees that would accumulate using a custodial exchange. A decentralized exchange is best used when the user wants to use some aspect of DeFi.  
Users should not keep their crypto on exchanges for long periods of time. Crypto should only be on the exchange if actively being traded. Users should also be aware of platforms that don't provide the user their keys. If the user doesn't have access to their keys, they are not the sole owner of their crypto.  
_*Note: Some exchanges are not allowed in some regions*_  
__**DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE COMMITTING TO AN EXCHANGE**__

\### \[0X Protocol\]([https://0x.org/](https://0x.org/ "https://0x.org/"))  
\## Stablecoin\[Stablecoins\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp")) are nonvolatile cryptocurrency that attempt to equate to a form of fiat, in most cases USD. These cryptos are collaterally backed with fiat, crypto or they can be algorithmic with smart contracts.  
\## Smart Contracts\[Smart contracts\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp")) are a program on the blockchain that checks if the requirements of the contract are met. If you are familiar with technical terms, this is the blockchain equivalent of scripts. Ethereum was the first one to incorporate smart contracts. Here’s a quick \[video\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI")) explaining smart contracts and why they are important to cryptocurrency.  
\## Decentralized AppDecentralized Apps (\[DAPPS\]([https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/decentralized-applications-defi-dapps](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/decentralized-applications-defi-dapps "https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/decentralized-applications-defi-dapps"))) , similar to web apps are web apps built on top of the blockchain. These apps can connect to a wallet and process smart contracts.  
\## Decentralized FinanceDecentralized Finance (\[DEFI\]([https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi "https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi"))) is cryptocurrency as a service. It is a protocol that works with smart contracts, borrowing, lending, staking, and rewards. These services usually incorporate a decentralized exchange (DEX).  
\# List of Coins & TokensThis is a list of coins that you may say see in exchanges, mentioned in communities, or anywhere in the crypto space. There is no specific order after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.   
\## Proof of Work Coins  
\### \[Bitcoin\]([https://bitcoin.org/en/](https://bitcoin.org/en/ "https://bitcoin.org/en/")) - BTC (2009)The first cryptocurrency and will probably always sit at the top of the list. This is the most recognized cryptocurrency and will attract the most investors. Promised that peer to peer transactions could happen without centralization of a financial institution in a quick and cheap manner. Since its genesis in 2009, there have been some quirks with scalability. BTC has a supply limit of 21 million.  
\### \[Ethereum\]([https://ethereum.org/en/](https://ethereum.org/en/ "https://ethereum.org/en/")) - ETH (2015)Currently POW and is in the process of becoming \[POS\]([https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/ "https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/")). Ethereum introduced smart contracts to cryptocurrency. Due to this, it has created the largest development ecosystem and network of tokens, DAPPS and DEFI. \[Transactions\]([https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/ "https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/")) with Ether require \[gas\]([https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/ "https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/")) which in turn pay miners in compensation of mining blocks. Due to the high transaction rate that Ether has due to popularity, gas prices are abnormally high. This has happened before in 2017 when the network would get congested from \[Crypto Kitties\]([https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162 "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162")). Ether currently has scaling problems and hopes to fix it with POS, Layer 2.0 and some other implementations. In the meantime gas, fees and congestion will be a side effect of its popularity. There is no supply limit on ETH.  
\### \[Litecoin\]([https://litecoin.org/](https://litecoin.org/ "https://litecoin.org/")) - LTC (2011)A direct fork of Bitcoin, it is supposed to accomplish everything Bitcoin does, but faster and cheaper. Litecoin aimed to process blocks every two and half minutes in comparison to Bitcoins ten minute blocks. Litecoin also uses a \[different algorithm\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin")) than Bitcoin in its POW. LTC has a supply limit of 84 million.  
\### \[Monero\]([https://www.getmonero.org/](https://www.getmonero.org/ "https://www.getmonero.org/")) - XMR (2014)The completely private cryptocurrency. It's public ledger is obfuscated and the user has absolute privacy. Monero is \[forked from Bytecoin\]([https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/monero#the-history-of-monero](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/monero#the-history-of-monero "https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/monero#the-history-of-monero")) which utilized a technology called CryptoNote. XMR has a supply limit of 18.4 million.  
\### \[Ethereum Classic\]([https://ethereumclassic.org/](https://ethereumclassic.org/ "https://ethereumclassic.org/")) - ETC (2015)ETC emerged from Ethereum after a hack in 2016. Ethereum returned the funds, while there was a group of users that didn't want the fork to happen due to the immutable ideology of the blockchain, this group was later coined \[Ethereum Classic\]([https://www.coindesk.com/crypto/ethereum-classic](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto/ethereum-classic "https://www.coindesk.com/crypto/ethereum-classic")). ETC has a supply limit of 210.7 million.  
\### \[Bitcoin Cash\]([https://bch.info/en/](https://bch.info/en/ "https://bch.info/en/")) - BCH (2017)A hard fork of Bitcoin in 2017 from when the community didn't come to an agreement with how Bitcoin should scale. BCH aims to be used like regular fiat, quick with minimum transaction fees at a micro level. BCH has a supply limit of 21 million.  
\### \[Dash\]([https://www.dash.org/](https://www.dash.org/ "https://www.dash.org/")) - DASH (2014)A fork of the Bitcoin protocol and originally named Xcoin and then Darkcoin. Eventual rebranding in 2015 came to be as Dash, Digital Cash with privacy in mind. DASH has a supply limit of 18.9 million.  
\### \[Zcash\](https://z.cash/) - ZEC (2016)Another privacy coin like Monero and Dash. ZEC has a supply limit of 21 million.

How the user wants to use these asset tokens is up them. RVC has a supply limit of 21 billion.  
\### \[Grin\]([https://grin.mw/](https://grin.mw/ "https://grin.mw/")) - GRIN (2019)Grin is based on the Mimblewimble protocol which is supposed to incorporate privacy and scalability. \[Grin\]([https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/grin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/grin/ "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/grin/")) is a community driven project and just like Bitcoin, the creators have taken after pseudonyms. Grin does not have a supply limit.  
\### \[Beam\]([https://beam.mw/](https://beam.mw/ "https://beam.mw/")) - BEAM (2018)Beam is another privacy coin that aims to scale based on the Mimblewimble protocol. BEAM has a supply limit of 262 million.  
\### \[Doge\]([https://dogecoin.com/](https://dogecoin.com/ "https://dogecoin.com/")) - DOGE (2013)Forked from Litecoin in 2013 with its supply uncapped. It's origin was supposed to be a fun and friendly currency based on the \[Doge meme\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_ "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_")(meme)). Doge coin has gained a lot of attention in 2021 making it very controversial.  
\## Proof of Stake Coins/ Tokens  
__**___*NOTE:**_ __Avoid staking coins and tokens on exchanges. Exchanges usually do not delegate their votes and generally offer a lower APY. As always, do your own research and find the best way for you to stake your investments.*__

\# Additional Information  
\## Be Aware of Crypto Cults and ScamsThe technologies that surround blockchains and cryptocurrencies are more than investments. They are technological platforms that have endless possibilities. Due to this you may think it's a good idea to join a community of your favorite crypto. Consider the following before joining.  
Some cryptos get a strong following because the technology is genuinely awesome. If you find yourself joining a community, it will feel borderline cultish if not already a cult. Every project has their pros and cons, it is important to realize this early on. Most of these cryptos are not even trying to replace each other, but complement one another by creating a vast ecosystem of different blockchains and technologies. Think of how many different brands there are and how they complement and compete with one another in the physical world like cars, stores, banks and etc.  
Cryptos get a lot of attention, pump and dumps are a common way for users to get conned. Be careful with what you invest in and always do your due diligence before finding out the next best pump and dump. They are most likely conning you if they are telling you about it.  
Hype and popularity won't boost a crypto much. Don't expect a moonshot or Lambo right away. Patience is a virtue. Investing in crypto is like putting your money on a rollercoaster. It's going to go up and down a lot because it's highly volatile. Once you think it can't go down more, it will go down even further.  
__**BE AWARE OF SCAMMERS**__. Anyone that asks for your private keys, recovery phrases, etc. are phishing and trying to scam you. It is common for a user to state they are with X Company and they are trying to help, offer an airdrop, or other forms of phishing techniques. Some are more obvious than others and anytime this happens, they have malicious intent.  
Buy, sell, or hodl? If you find yourself needing to ask for advice on buying or selling constantly, you may need to reevaluate your current knowledge and position with crypto and how markets work. Most community members will say buy the dips and hodl indefinitely. Just because this is what the general consensus is, doesn't mean it's the best advice for you. There are many variables that are in play and changes from one portfolio to another. Don't believe anyone on the internet when it comes to financial advice. __**DO YOU OWN RESEARCH AND DUE DILIGENCE. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR CRYPTO.**__  
_*This is not financial advice.*_  
\## ICO\[Initial Coin Offering\]([https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/ "https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/")) (ICO) is basically a Kickstarter for a startup crypto. A user gives money to this company and once the crypto is ready for release, they will give the user some crypto in return. The user won't own a share of the company, but the crypto the company created. These can be tricky because anyone can start an ICO and most of them end up being scams. Do your due diligence before investing.  
\## The Difference Between Cryptocurrencies and Digital AssetsUnderstanding the \[difference\]([https://medium.com/@xaurumofficial/the-difference-between-cryptocurrency-and-digital-assets-and-why-should-holders-care-33e00c62a3b9#:\~:text=Cryptocurrency%20is%20a%20dig,the%20right%20to%20use%20it.](https://medium.com/@xaurumofficial/the-difference-between-cryptocurrency-and-digital-assets-and-why-should-holders-care-33e00c62a3b9#:\~:text=Cryptocurrency%20is%20a%20dig,the%20right%20to%20use%20it.

Cryptocurrency represents a unit of currency, while a digital asset can represent anything in the digital space.  
\## NFTsNon-Fungible Tokens are a token that is unique from one another and is immutable. It can represent ownership of a digital asset. An example of this would be digital art. Everyone can view it and or save it to their device, but not everyone owns it. This creates exclusivity to digital media and other forms. NFTs aren't limited to the digital realm and can cross to the physical realm with some creativity.  
In short, NFTs store a link to the location of the asset.  
The potential owners have to ask themselves a few questions before buying a NFT out right. What happens when the site is taken down and the link to the image isn't there anymore? Sure, you still have the token that says you own the art, but the original source that confirms it doesn't exist anymore. Does the NFT contain InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) data? \[Luckily, the community is starting to ask these questions\]([https://www.coindesk.com/its-an-nft-boom-do-you-know-where-your-digital-art-lives](https://www.coindesk.com/its-an-nft-boom-do-you-know-where-your-digital-art-lives "https://www.coindesk.com/its-an-nft-boom-do-you-know-where-your-digital-art-lives")). Some companies are already trying to fill that gap like \[Pinata\]([https://medium.com/pinata/who-is-responsible-for-nft-data-99fb4e8147e4](https://medium.com/pinata/who-is-responsible-for-nft-data-99fb4e8147e4 "https://medium.com/pinata/who-is-responsible-for-nft-data-99fb4e8147e4")). This can only improve more and more with awareness of how NFTs work.  
\### NFT MarketplacesNFT marketplaces are a site where users can create, sell, buy, or trade NFTs. These sites differ in their own ways and how serious a user might be. Some may focus more on a specific niche, cover a broad audience or have a higher barrier for entry. Whichever platform you use, always do your own research.

In this example of WBTC, this is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin. If Bitcoins value goes up so does WBTC. If Bitcoins value goes down, so does WBTC.
